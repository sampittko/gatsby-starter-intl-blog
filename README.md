## Internationalization

This starter supports addition of new languages out of the box.

### Adding Support For a New Language

Replace `[language-key]` with the actual language key that represents the language that is to be added.

1. Open [gatsby-config.js](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/gatsby-config.js) file

   1. Extend configuration of <u>gatsby-plugin-intl</u>

      - Add a new `[language-key]` to `options.languages` array
      - Add a new `[language-key]` to `options.external.languageStrings` array

   2. Extend configuration of <u>gatsby-source-filesystem</u> by adding the following entry

      ```javascript
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
        options: {
        name: `[language-key]/blog`,
        path: `${__dirname}/content/[language-key]/blog`,
      },
      ```

2. Open [locales](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/src/locales/) folder and create a new `[language-key].json` file with corresponding translations

3. Open [content](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/content/) folder and create a new `/[language-key]/blog/` folder (ideally with translated existing articles included)

   - Important note: **keep the folder names of individual articles consistent across supported languages** (e.g. <u>/content/en/blog/this-is-my-first-blog-post/</u>, <u>/content/sk/blog/this-is-my-first-blog-post/</u> and <u>/content/si/blog/this-is-my-first-blog-post/</u>)
   - Suggestion: keep folders names of articles (blog posts titles in other words) and their categories in the default language (e.g. default language of the website in the example mentioned above would be English)

4. Extend existing GraphQL queries in the [hooks](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/src/hooks/) folder by adding the newly added language

5. **You are done.**

### Change Default Language

**Default language** is selected at the very first load of the website if the browser language of a visitor does not match any of the supported languages or it cannot be read correctly. Execute the following steps in order to change it:

1. Open [gatsby-config.js](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/gatsby-config.js) file and navigate to the configuration of <u>gatsby-plugin-intl</u>
2. Change the value of `options.external.defaultLanguage` key with wanted language key
3. **You are done.**
