## Internationalization

This starter supports addition of new languages out of the box.

### Rules

You need to follow certain rules for internationalization to work correctly. Breaking any of the following rules may cause internationalization to not work.

1. Keep folders names of individual articles consistent across supported languages (e.g. <u>/content/en/blog/life-hacks/this-is-my-first-blog-post/</u>, <u>/content/sk/blog/life-hacks/this-is-my-first-blog-post/</u> and <u>/content/si/blog/life-hacks/this-is-my-first-blog-post/</u>)
2. Prefix blog post folder name with it's category name (e.g. <u>life-hacks</u> from the example above)
3. Use **at least** `post_title`, `post_category` and `post_date` in frontmatter of article's MD file
4. Make `post_category` field inside frontmatter consistent across all blog posts in the category's folder

```markdown
---
page_description: This is a super blog 2 						# Use for better SEO
post_title: Ahojqiq
post_description: How to get consistent thoughts 		# Use for custom excerpt
post_category: Zamyslenia
post_date: "2020-04-05"
post_published: true 																# Use when blog post is just a draft
---
```

Suggestion: keep folders names of articles (blog posts titles in other words) and their categories in the default language (e.g. default language of the website in the example mentioned above would be English)

### Adding Support For a New Language

Replace `[language-key]` with the actual language key that represents the language that is to be added.

1. Open [gatsby-config.js](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/gatsby-config.js) file

   1. Extend configuration of <u>gatsby-plugin-intl</u>

      - Add a new `[language-key]` to `options.languages` array
      - Add a new `[language-key]` to `options.external.languageStrings` array

   2. Extend configuration of <u>gatsby-source-filesystem</u> by adding the following entry

      ```javascript
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
        options: {
        name: `[language-key]/blog`,
        path: `${__dirname}/content/[language-key]/blog`,
      },
      ```

2. Open [locales](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/src/locales/) folder and create a new `[language-key].json` file with corresponding translations

3. Open [content](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/content/) folder and create a new `/[language-key]/blog/` folder (ideally with translated existing articles included)

4. Extend existing GraphQL queries in the [hooks](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/src/hooks/) folder by adding the newly added language

5. Extend existing GraphQL page queries in [blog.js](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/src/templates/blog/blog.js) and [category.js](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/src/templates/blog/category.js) by adding the newly added language

6. **You are done**

### Change Default Language

**Default language** is selected at the very first load of the website if the browser language of a visitor does not match any of the supported languages or it cannot be read correctly. Execute the following steps in order to change it:

1. Open [gatsby-config.js](https://github.com/sampittko/gatsby-starter-intl-blog/blob/master/gatsby-config.js) file and navigate to the configuration of <u>gatsby-plugin-intl</u>
2. Change the value of `options.external.defaultLanguage` key with wanted language key
3. **You are done**
